"""Incremental date-range resolution shared by every job.

Run a job on a daily schedule with no START_DATE/END_DATE set, and it pulls
a rolling window of the past LOOKBACK_DAYS days (default 14), anchored on
yesterday -- today's stats are still accumulating in Pinterest's system, so
we don't pull a partial day. Re-pulling a 14-day window every run (instead of
just "yesterday") is deliberate: Pinterest revises spend/conversion metrics
for a date within its attribution window after the fact, and each job's
Iceberg MERGE INTO makes re-pulling overlapping days safe -- it overwrites
existing rows rather than duplicating them. Pass explicit START_DATE/END_DATE
for one-off backfills.
